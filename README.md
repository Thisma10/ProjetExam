# ProjetExam

First you need to upload WAMP and install it. We have the Database marvel.sql to import in phpmyadmin. after we can create a folder in C:\wamp\www and put the project in.

Start the wamp server, and open that adress ( http://projetexam/admin/index.php ). (projetexam is the name of my project, so put your folder name).
